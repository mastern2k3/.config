# .config
My slowly growing collection of configuration files

> Heavily inspired by [rafi's](https://github.com/rafi) [.config](https://github.com/rafi/.config) repo and configurations.

## Noteable Features

* Nord theme (Alacritty and vim)
* NeoVim
* Tmux config based on [.tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux)
